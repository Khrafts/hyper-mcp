## Example Conversations

Your account is healthy with 77% available balance.
```

### 2. Market Analysis

**You**: "What's the current BTC price and recent price action?"

**Claude**:

```
Let me get the current BTC market data for you.

Using tools: hyperliquid_get_all_prices, hyperliquid_get_candles

Current BTC Market Data:
‚Ä¢ Price: $67,450.00 (+2.3% today)
‚Ä¢ 24h High: $68,200.00
‚Ä¢ 24h Low: $65,800.00
‚Ä¢ Volume: $1.2B

Recent Price Action (1H candles):
‚Ä¢ Strong upward momentum over last 4 hours
‚Ä¢ Broke resistance at $67,000
‚Ä¢ RSI: 68 (approaching overbought)
‚Ä¢ Support level: $66,500

The price action suggests continued bullish momentum with potential resistance around $68,200.
```

### 3. Trading Operations

**You**: "I want to buy 0.1 BTC at $66,500 if the price dips. Set up a limit order."

**Claude**:

```
I'll place a limit buy order for 0.1 BTC at $66,500.

Using tool: hyperliquid_place_limit_order

Order Details:
‚Ä¢ Side: BUY
‚Ä¢ Amount: 0.1 BTC
‚Ä¢ Price: $66,500.00
‚Ä¢ Type: Limit (Good Till Canceled)
‚Ä¢ Estimated Value: $6,650.00

Checking your account... ‚úÖ Sufficient balance available

Placing order... ‚úÖ Order placed successfully!

Order ID: #789123
Status: Open (waiting for price to reach $66,500)

I'll monitor this order. The current price is $67,450, so you're looking for a $950 dip to fill.
```

### 4. Risk Management

**You**: "Check if my portfolio has any risk issues and set up some alerts"

**Claude**:

```
Let me analyze your portfolio risk profile.

Using tools: risk_get_portfolio_analysis, risk_check_order

Portfolio Risk Analysis:
‚Ä¢ Overall Risk Score: Medium (6/10)
‚Ä¢ Concentration Risk: ‚ö†Ô∏è High BTC exposure (65% of portfolio)
‚Ä¢ Leverage: Low (1.2x) ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Diversification: Poor (only 2 assets) ‚ö†Ô∏è

Recommendations:
1. Consider reducing BTC concentration below 50%
2. Add exposure to other assets (ETH, SOL, etc.)
3. Your leverage is conservative - good for risk management

Setting up alerts:
‚úÖ Portfolio value drops below $2,200 (-10%)
‚úÖ BTC position exceeds 70% of portfolio
‚úÖ Any single position loses more than 5% in 1 hour

Alerts configured and active. You'll be notified if any triggers occur.
```

### 5. Advanced Market Intelligence

**You**: "Give me a comprehensive market report before I make my next trade"

**Claude**:

```
I'll generate a comprehensive market intelligence report for you.

Using tools: market_intelligence_report, market_intelligence_sentiment
